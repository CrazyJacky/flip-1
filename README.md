# Mobicore

There is a fair bit of dissatisfaction about the weight of some the mobile libraries around, and additionally the lack of help they give you as both an experienced mobile web (apps) developer or as a first-timer.

This library is an attempt to do just the basics, and no more than that.  Combine it with appropriate other libraries (see the list of supported libraries) for UI styling or just bring in an appropriate UI stylesheet. It's up to you.

At the heart of mobicore is the excellent event router,  [Eve](https://github.com/DmitryBaranovskiy/eve) which makes working with mobile apps wonderful again.  Additionally, I make use of my own touch helper library called [Interact](http://github.com/DamonOehlman/interact) to try and put an end to [Borked Touch Events](http://distractable.net/mobile/borked-touch-events) that you will experience when using multiple libraries that attempt to handle touch together.
